Weekly updated CentOS Docker images
===================================

Those images are just standard CentOS base images, but:
1. With all the package updates installed weekly.
2. Squashed to single layer for smaller size.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

* [latest, stream, stream9, 9, 3.0.1-stream9, 3.0.1](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-centos/blob/master/stream9/Dockerfile)
* [stream8, 8, 3.0.1-stream8](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-centos/blob/master/stream8/Dockerfile)
* [centos7, 7, 3.0.1-centos7](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-centos/blob/master/centos7/Dockerfile)

Version numbers use [SemVer](https://semver.org) and they reflect changes done in this repo - they are NOT related to CentOS versioning. For example, each weekly build will rise version number on last place, meaning patch level update.

## Updates

CentOS Team stopped updating their base images on Docker hub.  They moved to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/centos/centos?tab=tags) now, but even there images for CentOS 7 and CentOS 8 are around half a year old. I decided to rebuild them weekly, installing all updates.
